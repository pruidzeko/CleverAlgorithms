\chapter{Advanced Topics}
\label{ch:advanced}
This chapter discusses a number of advanced topics that may be considered once one or more of the algorithms described in this book have been mastered.

The topics in this section consider some practical concerns such as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item How to implement an algorithm using a different programming paradigm (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:paradigms}).
  \item How to devise and investigate a new biologically-inspired algorithm (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:new_algorithms}).
  \item How to test algorithm implementations to ensure they are implemented correctly (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:testing_algorithms}).
  \item How to visualize problems, algorithm behavior and candidate solutions (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:visualizing_algorithms}).
  \item How to direct these algorithms toward practical problem solving (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:problem_solving}).
  \item Issues to consider when benchmarking and comparing the capabilities of algorithms (Section~\ref{advanced:sec:racing_algorithms}).
\end{itemize}

The objective of this chapter is to illustrate the concerns and skills necessary for taking the algorithms described in this book into the real-world.
